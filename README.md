# Hi there, I'm about to be a _Mechatronics Engineer_ :jack_o_lantern:

I'm about to finish school and also taking courses about programming on different websites. I've used several languages such as:

* :electron: Embedded C (Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects)
* :globe_with_meridians: HTML, CSS and Javascript (web dev)
* 🔐Basics of SQL, C++ and Java
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: MATLAB for numerical and signal analysis

## Interests
🔭 I’m currently working on my future interests, which are:
* _AI and Machine Learning_
* _Data science_
* _Robotics and augmented reality_
* _Design_
