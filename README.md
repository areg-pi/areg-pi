# Hi there, I'm about to be a Mechatronics Engineer :jack_o_lantern:

I'm about to finish school and also taking courses about programming on different websites. I've used several languages such as:
* Python (with frameworks/ libraries: Pandas, Dash, Scipy, OpenCV and Tkinter)
* Embedded C (Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects)
* HTML, CSS and Javascript (web dev)
* Basics of SQL, C++ and Java
* MATLAB for numerical and signal analysis

I also feel comfortable with different OS environments and distros like:
* Linux (Kali, Ubuntu, Raspbian)
* MacOS
* Windows

And, just because they're always useful for memes and stuff, I can use Photoshop and Illustrator.

I rarely make random tech videos for my [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYj0Ynyf3R3MOAxOC6Mzxg)
