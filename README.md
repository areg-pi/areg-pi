# Hi there, I'm about to be a _**Mechatronics Engineer**_ :jack_o_lantern:

I'm about to finish school and also taking courses about programming on different websites. I've used several languages such as:
* 🤖 Python (with frameworks/ libraries: Pandas, Scikit, Dash, Scipy, OpenCV and Tkinter)
* :electron: Embedded C (Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects)
* :globe_with_meridians: HTML, CSS and Javascript (web dev)
* 🔐Basics of SQL, C++ and Java
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: MATLAB for numerical and signal analysis

🔭 I’m currently working on my future interests, which are:
* _AI and Machine Learning
* _Data science
* _Robotics and augmented reality
* _Design

You can also find me in [LinkedIn]
I rarely make random tech videos for my [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYj0Ynyf3R3MOAxOC6Mzxg)

One last thing, just because they're always useful for memes and stuff, I can use:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator.
