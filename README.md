# Hello there, I'm a _Mechatronics Engineer_ :jack_o_lantern:

I just finished university and also taking courses about computer science in different websites. I've used several languages such as:

* :globe_with_meridians: HTML, CSS and Javascript (web dev)
* 🔐Basics of SQL, C++ and Java
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: MATLAB for numerical and signal analysis

## 🔭 Interests
I’m currently working on my future interests, which are:
* AI and Machine Learning
* Data science
* Robotics and augmented reality
