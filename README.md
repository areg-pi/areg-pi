# Hi there, I'm about to be a _**Mechatronics Engineer**_ :jack_o_lantern:

I'm about to finish school and also taking courses about programming on different websites. I've used several languages such as:
* ü§ñ Python (with frameworks/ libraries: Pandas, Scikit, Dash, Scipy, OpenCV and Tkinter)
* :electron: Embedded C (Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects)
* :globe_with_meridians: HTML, CSS and Javascript (web dev)
* üîêBasics of SQL, C++ and Java
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: MATLAB for numerical and signal analysis

I also feel comfortable with different OS environments and distros like:
* Linux (Kali, Ubuntu, Raspbian)
* MacOS
* Windows

One last thing, just because they're always useful for memes and stuff, I can use:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator.

I rarely make random tech videos for my [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYj0Ynyf3R3MOAxOC6Mzxg)
