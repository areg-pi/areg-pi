# Hello there :jack_o_lantern:

I recently finished university and I'm working as QA Engineer. I'm also taking computer science courses (usually). I've used several tools such as:
* 🤖 Python (with frameworks/libraries: Pandas, Scikit, Dash, Scipy, OpenCV and Tkinter)
* :electron: Embedded C (Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects)
* :globe_with_meridians: HTML, CSS and Javascript (web dev)
* 🔐Basics of SQL, C++ and Java
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: MATLAB for numerical and signal analysis (long time ago)

## 🔭 Interests
I’m currently working on some of my future interests, but in general, I like:
* AI, Machine Learning, Robotics and AR
* Design in general
* Sport Karate
* To play the piano

Also, just because they're always useful for memes and stuff, I use too:
* Adobe Photoshop :camera:
* Adobe Illustrator :space_invader:
